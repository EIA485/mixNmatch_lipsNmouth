A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/)  
Fixes Issue 3340, allows for differing makes and models of Eye and Face Trackers to operate together. This also fixes some underlying issues, and will be needed for (my) eye and face tracking mods

https://github.com/Neos-Metaverse/NeosPublic/issues/3440

## Usage
0. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Build and place your DLL under "nml_mods". This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader.
2. Start the game!

Thanks to those who helped me test this!
